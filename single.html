									Currently, there is a system which can calculate the current run rate and from it it calculates the final score of the team. It doesn’t consider the fact about the no of wickets and also where the game is being played. The problem with the current system is that it is unable to predict the score of the 2nd team and also unable to predict the win percentage This system which is developed will have 2 model in it the 1st model predict the score a team will get after playing 50 over from the current situation . The second method predicts the win percentage of both teams even before the match has started this done by player selection. We found that error in regression toward the mean classifier could be a smaller quantity than Naïve mathematician in predicting match outcome has been sixty-eight ab initio from 2-15 overs to ninety-one until the top of 42th over

											In this paper, we show that by solving the app attribution problem we can automate the dynamic analysis of Android apps. We show this through developing a framework performing comprehensive step by step dynamic and automated teardown of the app registration and login procedures and their SSL endpoints. Using our app attribution solution to map network traffic to back to the apps and prevalent Android vulnerabilities spanning mishandled certificate validation, do-it-yourself cryptography, improper server configuration and other forms of information leakage, we were able to perform an automated man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt and monitor user traffic. Our analyses confirm earlier studies that 41% of Android apps are vulnerable to SSL/TLS man-in-the-middle attacks and 90% of them have at least have one major vulnerability potentially harming user confidentiality.  Through this, we demonstrate that our automated system is an efficient and scalable solution for analysing Android apps dynamically.

									Cricket is the foremost loved game, after football. The sport begins in England within the sixteenth century. Today, it's not just a game in India it’s a religion with more and more fan increasing the world the game cricket may even overtake football as the most fan base sport in the world. There are 3 format namely 
An ODI match which consist of 50 over which is completed in a day . Second being the test format this is the old format of the game it is played in 5 days which consist of 2 inning from both team it consist of 80 to 90 over game in a day . The team has to consistently perform for 5 days . This is very challenging format of the game where a player endurance , strength, patience and mentality matter the most. The 3rd and the newest format of cricket is the t20 format . this format was introduced in the 2006 and had its first world cup in 2007 which was won by India . it is a fast game which consist of 20 over this game is over under 3 hour . It consist of 2 team where each team get 20 over to play . The t20 format is very popular in India because of IPL . This tournament is the reason for the rise of t20 format in India.
This system which is developed will have 2 model in it the 1st model predict the score a team will get after playing 50 over drom the current situation. The second method predicts the win percentage of both teams even before the match has started this done by player selection.
The elemental objective of this paper is to consolidate past matches data and in-diversion data keeping in mind the top goal to arrange the simplest discerning model. For outlining the nice discerning model: range of wickets fallen, setting of the match, positioning of the batting cluster, hurl, and homegroup advantage these parameters are thought of. As no such analysishas improved true this organization of cricket, thus this may be chosen to require the take a look at as cricket matches are particularly distinguished these days.

									In this system we are going to predict the outcome as well as the score after 50 over from the current situation. Also we are going to predict the win percentage of the teams who are playing the game based on the squad selected. this system will not be only beneficial for the audience but also for the team selector as they can predict the win percentage on a particular team. 
									</p>
									<p>
									This system tries to predict the score and winning chance a team has over another team. we tend to use Naïve Thomas Bayes, Random Forest, multiclass SVM, and call Tree classifiers to induce the prediction models for each the problems. Random Forest classifier was found to be the foremost correct for each issue. it'll facilitate predict the score of the team from the present over to fiftieth over in AN ODI match. it'll use the present over, current runs scored, no of wickets, runs created by the striker, runs created by the non-striker.
This system also will facilitate in predicting the win share of the 2 teams. For this, we've got used information from the last seventeen years (2000-2017). This information is taken from the espn.com with the assistance of net scraping. This we tend to change the United States to match each the groups on the concept of their player performance that embrace run rate , strike rate , no of runs, last season performance for the batsmen. For the bowler and every one rounder we'll be ready to compare on the idea of wickets taken , economy, what percentage ball needed to require a wicket. For score prediction data is taken from the info base which contains the last 5 year performance of all teams and their team member. When the user enter the no of runs , over, wicket and press the calculate button it'll immediately process the info given by the user and begin calculating on the idea of the database this may enable for a accurate prediction of score .
